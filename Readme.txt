We Download stuff or just quickly put it on our Desktop. We tell ourselves this is just for some some seconds, we'll clean our Desktop later. 
Well, here we are. The Desktop filled with files that should have been organized days, months, sometimes even years ago.

Today ill declare war on a untidy Desktop. This is where this little script will come in Handy. Its supposed to organize Data by Filetype and copy it into the right folders.

Here some User Stories to help me get structure:
- As a user i just want to click the icon, and my desktop is cleaned.
- But "Cleaned" doesnt necessarily mean "empty". -> as a user i want some folders/files on Desktop. 
- "cleaned" also doesnt mean "deleted" - that would be a cheap organizer :P       -> the files should be organized in an appropriate folder.
